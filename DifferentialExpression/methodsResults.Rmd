## Title 
Differential Expression Analysis

<<<<<<< HEAD
##Author

'''{r, eval=do it}
=======
## Method
The purpose of this module is to determine the difference in gene expression.Firstly Salmon [@Patro] was used to quantify the RNA-seq data, then mergeKo.R was written to create a table for mapping transcripts to gene. Secondly, tximport[@Soneson] was applied to import the Salmon abundance estimates data, and lastly, DESeq2[@Love] was used to perform differential expression analysis.After the analysis was done, differently expressed genes(p value < 0.05) were extracted.

## Result
```{R,eval=TRUE}
library(knitr)

deAnnotate <- read.csv("deAnnotate.csv")
keggId <- deAnnotate$kegg
nonRep <- matrix(unlist(unique(keggId)), ncol = 6)
colnames(nonRep)[1:6] <- "gene kegg ID"
kable(nonRep)
