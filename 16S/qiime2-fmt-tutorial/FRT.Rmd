## Title
FMT study method

## Method

This tutorial is derived from Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) study (@Kang). First demux method was used to produce summarized table, than DADA2(@Callahan) was used to perform quality control on 1% sequenced sample data, with denoise-single method. Last the sequences results and frequency results were merged. Further diversity analysis can be applied to FeatureTable[Frequency] and FeatureData[Sequence] objects.  
## Sample data

```{R,eval=TRUE}
library(knitr)
sample.metadata <- read.table(file = "sample_metadata.tsv", sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
kable(sample.metadata[1:10,])
```
