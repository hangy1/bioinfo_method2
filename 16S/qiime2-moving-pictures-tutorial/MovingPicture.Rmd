## Title
Moving Picture Method

## Method

The moving picture tutorial uses QIIME2 to analyze human microbiome samples(@Kuczynski) from published sample data (@Caporaso). First step was demultiplexing sequence, then Deblur(@Amir) method was used to perform quality control.Then visual summaries was created by using qiime feature-table methods.The summarized data was used to perform phylogenetic analysis, Alpha and beta diversity analysis, Alpha rarefaction plotting, Taxonomic analysis, and differential abundance testing with ANCOM(@Mandal).

## Sample data

```{R,eval=TRUE}
library(knitr)
sample.metadata <- read.table(file = "sample_metadata.tsv", sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
kable(sample.metadata[1:10,])
```
